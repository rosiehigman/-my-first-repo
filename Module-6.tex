\section{MODULE VI.}
\subsection{Dwarf planets and smaller bodies.}

Asteroids, Lagrange points, Kuiper belt bodies, comets and the Oort cloud. Origin, internal structures, chemical composition, surface morphologies, meteor showers.

At the end of this module you should be able to describe: 

\begin{itemize}
\item  The distribution, sizes, general composition and internal
structure of smaller bodies in the inner and outer solar system
\item  Their violent influence on the surfaces of terrestrial bodies along the history of the solar system
\item  Their contribution with chemical compounds associated with life (water and complex organics)
\item  The time coincidence between the late heavy bombardment and the first fossils on Earth (3.8Gy ago)
\item  The structure of comets and their evolution as they come near the sun
 \end{itemize}
